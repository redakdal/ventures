## General info
TUGv2.0 was going to be a Free 2 play, Thanks to IGG, who invested in them, they remade the origanlly TUG game in opengl. It was going to replace TUG on steam, but in mid 2017 IGG sent them back to redevelopment for a failed internal test. This is the Developer build that was given to Devs and modders in early 2017. A backer of that closed build shared it with the community and our goal is to bring all of it on github, and to encourage others who want to finish or mess with it, or if your backer, to be able to play the game you were promised.  BEFORE DOWNLOADING This is a Developer build only, and has many bugs and problem due to it being not finished


## Technologies
* the eternus engine
opengl
c++
Java  
coming soon

## Setup
download the zip file, and extract it anywhere,  the batch files are what complies it together and runs it, please note: the build does not have any type of past testing that we know off, so we can not help you yet until others test it more and tell us the state of what runs and what is broken

## Features
many dev tools and assets that were not complete at the time of this build

To-do list:
* requirements- opengl 4.3 or later
* add more detail whats in the build
*add people to team
*add all files, that cannot be uploaded more then 15 or so files at once

## Status
Officially the TUGv2.0 game was abandoned at the end of 2017,  This dev build can control and modify the game in more ways then one and while Nerdkingdom is offically gone, we hope that by releasing this, their work won't be forgotton and can be continued or  added upon 
## Inspiration
the backers, the players and others of the community that came back to help us, and everyone else that worked on TUG and TUGv2.0, I and others shared this because we were inspired by all the work that was done on it, and how much of a shame no one got to see and play it, well until now!!
