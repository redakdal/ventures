## Purpose of
 The main sole purpose of this github copy is for the backers and others who were promised TUGv2.0 at the end of 2017. I with the help of a backer who donated it, have put it here for anyone who wishes to work on mods for the game or help finish it as it is not very playable in its current state as well as use any part of the code for non-commerial purposes in any project they want.
